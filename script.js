// W00t! How the hell did you do that without Javascript? 
//
// This pen is part of a series of CSS-only SVG animations intended to progressively explain how SVG images can be animated in a cool way without using any Javascript and, of course, without ending with a hell of a mess in the Sass file/s.
// Feel free to toy around. 
// That's precisely why I created these pens for. :). 
//
// P.S.: Please note that this pen may only work on Webkit/Blink browsers due to a bug with transform-origin on Firefox.
